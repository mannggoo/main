== Introduction

Extremely Loud and Intelligent Student Assistant (ELISA) is for students who *wants to have an intelligent companion that keeps track of tasks and give friendly reminders on when to take breaks*. More importantly, ELISA is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ELISA can get your tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `elisa.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for ELISA.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
